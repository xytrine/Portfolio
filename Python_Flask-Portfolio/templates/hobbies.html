        <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
        <p>Outside of web development, I enjoy hands-on activities that keep my mind and body active. Whether I’m fixing a gadget or working out at the gym, I like taking on challenges that help me learn new things, get better at what I do, and build something I can be proud of.</p>

            <h2>🔧 Fixing Devices</h2>
            <p>I’ve always been curious about how things work. I enjoy taking apart gadgets—like laptops, phones, or even watches—figuring out what’s wrong, and trying to fix them.</p>

            <h2>🏋️‍♂️ Fitness & Strength Training</h2>
            <p>The gym is my go-to place to clear my head and challenge myself. For me, it’s not just about building strength—it’s about staying consistent, pushing past limits, and growing both mentally and physically.</p>

            <h2>🚴 Riding Bikes</h2>
            <p>Riding my bike gives me a sense of freedom. I love the fresh air, the open road, and the chance to explore new places while staying active.</p>

            <h2>🚶 Walking & Exploring</h2>
            <p>It helps me relax, reset my thoughts, and notice the little things around me that I might otherwise miss.</p>

            <h2>🎵 Music</h2>
            <p>Music is a big part of my day—it helps me focus, lifts my mood, and adds energy or calm depending on what I need. It’s like a soundtrack to whatever I’m doing.</p>

            <h2>🎙️ Podcasts</h2>
            <p>I enjoy listening to podcasts that make me think, introduce me to new ideas, or just keep me entertained while I’m doing other things. It’s a great way to learn and stay inspired.</p>
